Promethues & Grafana
Prometheus is used to monitor the services, both EC2 and docker containers, where as Grafana is used to visualize the server
health. Prom by default runs on 9090 port and grafana runs on 3000 port. To scrape the matrices, prom uses node-exporter which
gives the server matrices. We can have multiple job_names with multiple targets. For scrapping ngnix logs, we can use nginx 
scrapper. For docker matrices scrapping we can use caadvisor.

We need to open ports 9090 internally for servers running in same location to communicate with Promethues.
To start prometheus download  prometheus, unzip it and go inside the set up and run the command prometheus & Also check the promethus.yml file
To start grafana, download it and unzip it. Go inside to /bin folder and run ./grafana &
Also install node exporter to export the server matrices.
You can skip promo and grafana set up if you are using docker compose set up 
You can use votes application to test the docker matrices
